Just wanted to get my hands dirty with phonegap and android development, and there is an existing put.io application for android but
it was giving errors, anyways I wrote a simple client for Putio. Its like having a gazillion of files in my pocket.

Please remember this is not even alpha, though works for me. It only has files/folders, watch videos etc. and can create mp3 playlists but thats all 
- no uploading, no transfers and no search yet.

You can download the apk file from http://goo.gl/wwlIk

Just a couple of things:
- real credits goes to flalanne for the amazing javascript api, it just works out of box, thank you. http://code.google.com/p/putio-js/ 
- you need to install Rock Player to watch avis, mkvs etc. https://market.android.com/details?id=com.redirectin.rockplayer.android.unified.lite
- you need to install Just Playlists for mp3 playlists to work. https://market.android.com/details?id=org.journeyman.android.apps.justplaylists
